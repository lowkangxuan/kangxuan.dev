## Background
Back in 2022, I created my first ever [portfolio website](https://lowkangxuan.github.io/) using Eleventy (11ty) and Bootstrap. The website was a testament to my
web development skills and honestly, I was proud of how it turned out.

Fast forward today, I challenged myself to rebuild my portfolio site with modern frameworks like React and TailwindCSS. My goal was to
still deliver a minimalist design and showcase my skills, experience, and projects while still
being able to write blog posts, like this!

Here's a small breakdown on the technology behind the site and how much it costs me to build it.

## Tech Stack
- Tanstack Start
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Shadcn/ui

## Features
- Minimalist design
- Blog updates
- Light & Dark mode
- Search Bar for quick-search purposes
- Live clock of my timezone (GMT +8)

## Cost Analysis
I could've saved a few dollars by not using any custom domain, but why make a site without a domain of my name (I found it cool let me cook).

The domain was purchased from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and like what the name suggests, it costed me roughly **$7/year**.
