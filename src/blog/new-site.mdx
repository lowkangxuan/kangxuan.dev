description: The technology behind the site
---
## Background
Back in 2022, I built my first ever [portfolio website](https://lowkangxuan.github.io/) using Eleventy (11ty) and Bootstrap. It was a testament to my web development skills at the time,
and honestly, I was proud of how it turned out.

Fast-forward to today, I challenged myself to rebuild my portfolio using modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS.
My goal was to maintain a minimalist design, similar to my previous portfolio website, and
sections to showcase my skills, experience, and projects while still having the flexibility to write blog posts like this one.

Here's a small breakdown on the technology behind the site and how much it costs me to build it.

## Tech Stack
- Tanstack Start
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Shadcn/ui

## Features
- Minimalist design
- Blog updates
- Light & Dark mode
- Search Bar for quick-search purposes
- Live clock of my timezone (GMT +8)

## Cost Analysis
I could have saved a few dollars by skipping a custom domain, but what’s the point of building a personal site without a domain in my own name? (I thought it was cool.)

I purchased the domain from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), and as the name suggests, it was pretty affordable. It costs me roughly **$7/year**.

## Final Thoughts
All in all, I'm very pleased with how things turned out, although there are still some other features I would like to add such as a search bar for
blog posts, but that can wait.

If you're reading this post and still contemplating creating your own portfolio website, just give it a go and enjoy the process!
